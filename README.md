# IQOD_Misc_30

## DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY

Using the function from IQOD_Misc_28, split a string at the index of it's vowel. Make the vowel and the end of the word stay at the front of a new string, and make everything at the beginning have a hyphen, then the front part of the word, then "ay" at the end. If the string doesn't have a vowel return the original string.

Example

Example:

```
array = "Kenn"
console.log(iqod(array))
array = "Erin"
console.log(iqod(array))
```
Output:
```
enn-Kay
Erin-ay
```
